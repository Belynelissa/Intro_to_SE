1. Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is the process of tracking and managing changes to a source code. Fundamentals include: 
a) Tracking changes. Changes made to the source code can be tracked down to the actual change, time and person who did the change.
b) Reverting changes. Changes made can be reversed if necessary.
c) Cloning. A user can clone a repository and make changes to it.
d) Commiting. Changes can be saved to the local repository.
e) Pushing. Changes can be sent from the local repository to the remote server. 
Githb is a popular tool for managing versions of code because it leverages Git to enable users track and manage sorce code and projects collaboratively.
Version control help in maintaining project integrity by tracking code changes, enabling collaboration in project management, enhancing security by prevention of errors, enabling faster itteration and delivery.


2. Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
Creating a new repository on Github:
i) Select and click "new" on the top left corner
ii) Type selected name for repository.
iii) Add a description of your repository(optional)
iv) Choose repository visibility( Private or public)
v) Select licence.
vi)Initialise repository with readme.md file in main
vii) Create new repository

Some of the important decisions to consider during this process include;
i) Name of the repository should be short and memorable.
ii) Visibility of the repository, whether public or private. Public repositories can be seen by any user without restrictions while private repositories have restrictions and need authentication.
ii) Licence. 


3. Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
A README file is atext file that communicates important information about your project. It displays expectations to your project, instructions on how to use it and helps manage contributions.
A well written README should have:
a) Project tittle. Name of your project and description in a sentence.
b) Project description. Extended version of your tittle further explaining project purpose, instructions, purpose and importance.
c) Table of contents. Lengthy projects can be hard to navigate and this is where it helps.
d) Technologies used. Let the users know the various technologies and tools you used in the course of the project.
e) Requirements. Make your project interaction easier by informing users of all requirements.


4. Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
The difference in public and private repositories lies in who can view the project. 
Public repositories can be viewed and cloned by anyone in the internet while private repositories can only be viewed by the owner and invited collaborators.

Advantages of public repositories in context to collaborative projects are:
a) Community support. Public projects benefit from feedback, reports and improvements from a wider audience.
b) Visibility and recognition. Projects are visible to awider audience including potential employers, collaborators and contributors.
c) Open collaboration. Encourages contribution from a broad community outside your team.
Disadvantages of public repositories are:
a) Lack of privacy. Unfinished work or important information is exposed to everyone.
b) 

Advantages of private repositories: 
a) Privacy. Protects sensitive information about projects from public access.
b) Custom workflows. Allows internal teams to experiment and test without public interference and scrutiny.
c) Controlled collaboration. Access is restricted to certain people enhancing focused contributions.
d) Security of intellectual property. Your work and project remains secure within your team.




Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
