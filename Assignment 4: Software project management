d) Identifies potential challenges for risk mitigation.
e) Establishes benchmarks for monitoring progress and measuring success against predefined deliverables.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierachical decomposition of aproject into smaller manageable comonents or tasks for easy work and management.
It is usefull for: 
a) Accountability. Team members are assigned clear tasks, roles and responsibilities.
b) Budgeting and resource allocation. Facilitates accurate estimation of costs and resource requirements for each component.
c) Risk identification. Helps identify potential problems that could affect quality and timely delivery of projects.
d) Task management. Ensures no work is overlooked by organizing tasks systematically.
e) Enhanced visibility. Provides a clear view of the entire project, helping stakeholders understand its structure and progress.


7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of developing a detailed project schedule: 
a) Help in assigning resources effectively by identifying when and where needed.
b) Improved time management. Ensures that tasks are completed on schedule, reducing risk of delay.
c) Provides a common framework for all stakeholders to understand project's progress and timelines.
d) Progress tracking. Allows project managers to monitor progress against the planned schedule and make adjustments if needed.
e) A well-structured schedule demonstrates professionalism and builds trust with stakeholders by showing that the project is well-planned.
A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing tasks, their durations, dependencies, and progress over time. It’s an essential tool for creating and managing detailed project schedules. They help in:
